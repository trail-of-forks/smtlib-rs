 :language
 "The language for this logic, QF_FF, is one that handles Quantifier-Free Finite Field arithmetic. Finite fields, also called Galois fields, are algebraic structures in which all operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, excluding division by zero) are well defined. Quantifier-free indicates that no universal or existential quantifiers are used in this logic, meaning statements are about specific objects in the domain, not generalities.
  In this language, the typical operations that can be used include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by zero). The language also assumes that all variables and constants belong to the finite field under consideration."
 :notes
 "The QF_FF logic is dedicated to handling arithmetic operations within a finite field, which has practical applications in various areas of computer science and mathematics including cryptography, coding theory, and polynomial computations.

  The specific finite field must be defined elsewhere, with the elements of the field typically represented as integer values. As there are no quantifiers, this logic is typically used for simpler, ground-level problems rather than complex or higher-order problems. It is also worth noting that the feasibility of problems in this logic can depend greatly on the order of the finite field.

  The FieldElements theory mentioned indicates that the primary elements under consideration in this logic are elements of the specified finite field. Arithmetic operations are performed on these field elements. The behavior of these operations is dictated by the rules of finite field arithmetic.

  Please note that the descriptions above are made based on general knowledge about finite fields and the information provided in your question. The actual language and notes of a specific QF_FF logic could vary based on the context or the specific requirements of a problem or a tool."
